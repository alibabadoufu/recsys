RM1234,2025-08-31 08:02:14 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Good morning Jane, how are things at Shopee?",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:02:40 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Morning John, doing well thanks. Been a bit concerned about USD/IDR volatility recently.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:03:05 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Yes, IDR has been under pressure. We’ve seen a lot of corporates hedging their USD exposure.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:03:42 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"That’s exactly the issue. Our settlement for suppliers is mainly in USD, but revenue is in local currency.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:04:10 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Understood. You could look into vanilla forwards or NDFs to manage that exposure.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:04:39 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"NDFs sound interesting. What tenor do clients usually take for e-commerce flows?",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:05:08 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Typically 1–3 months, aligned with payables. For longer visibility, some clients also layer in options.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:05:33 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Options may be useful if rates stabilize. But CFO is sensitive to upfront premium costs.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:06:01 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"We could structure zero-cost collars — limited downside protection without premium outlay.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:06:45 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"That could work. Let’s run some scenarios: USD/IDR at 16,500 and 17,000.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:07:15 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Sure, I’ll prepare payoff charts. Also, have you considered CNH exposure given Shopee’s expansion?",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:07:48 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Yes, China volumes are picking up, but hedging is tricky given regulations.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:08:22 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"True. Some clients use offshore CNH NDFs for flexibility. Could be worth exploring.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:08:57 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Noted. Let’s start with IDR exposure first. Please send me indicative pricing later today.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:09:20 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Will do. I’ll email you a term sheet with scenarios and suggested structures.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:09:51 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Thanks John. Also, any latest views on Fed policy? Market feels uncertain.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:10:30 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"FOMC minutes suggest a pause but inflation stickiness keeps USD supported. Expect choppy moves.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:11:04 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Got it. That aligns with what our treasury team flagged. Appreciate the insights.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:11:32 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Anytime. Let’s catch up later this week after you review the term sheet.",chat
RM1234,2025-08-31 08:11:59 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Sounds good. Speak soon.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-02 10:15:11 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Hi John, quick one — do you see USD/IDR stabilizing after Bank Indonesia’s intervention?",chat
RM1234,2025-09-02 10:15:44 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Hi Jane, BI’s moves should cap near-term volatility, but global risk sentiment is still a drag.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-02 10:16:22 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Makes sense. We may roll our forwards another month just to stay safe.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-02 10:16:49 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Good call. I can send you some rolling strategy illustrations if that helps.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-02 10:17:10 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Yes please, that would be helpful.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-04 18:32:51 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Hey Jane, how was your trip to Jakarta? Managed to avoid the traffic?",chat
RM1234,2025-09-04 18:33:27 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Haha, impossible! Took me 2 hours for a 20-minute ride. But food was amazing as always.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-04 18:34:02 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Classic Jakarta! At least you got good food. Did you try that new seafood place you mentioned?",chat
RM1234,2025-09-04 18:34:35 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Yes, it was great. Next time you’re here we should go.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-04 18:35:01 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Deal. I’ll hold you to that!",chat
RM1234,2025-09-08 07:48:15 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Morning John, quick check — any update on CNH liquidity conditions? We’re planning some settlements next week.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-08 07:49:02 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Liquidity has improved slightly post-holidays, spreads are tighter. Shouldn’t be an issue for next week.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-08 07:49:44 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Perfect, thanks for the heads-up.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-10 20:22:19 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Jane, just curious — are you following the EPL this season?",chat
RM1234,2025-09-10 20:22:51 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"Of course! Liverpool fan here. Don’t tell me you’re cheering for Man United…",chat
RM1234,2025-09-10 20:23:25 UTC,John Doe,USR001,Goldman Sachs,"Haha guilty. We might not survive this season though.",chat
RM1234,2025-09-10 20:23:59 UTC,Jane Doe,USR002,Shopee,"That’s okay, always good to have some banter outside FX markets!",chat
